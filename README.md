# LooseControlNet: Fused ControlNet Weights from LooseControl

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## How it works

In LooseControl, the authors trained a LoRA of `ControlNet-depth`, but now few libraries or frameworks support *LoRA of
ControlNet*, so they hacked through `ControlNetModel` of `diffusers` with `UNet2DConditionLoadersMixin`.

However, we can't run the code in frameworks like A1111's WebUI or ComfyUI, so we fused the weights
of `ControlNet-depth` and `LooseControl` to make it work in any frameworks. For details, please refer to [the script](./weight_fusion.py).

> *Important Note:*
> The authors of LooseControl did more than just training a LoRA. Let's not forget that. Please refer to the original paper and code for more
> details.

## Usage

Download the fused ControlNet weights from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/AIRDGempoll/LooseControlNet) and used it
anywhere (e.g. A1111's WebUI or ComfyUI) you can use `ControlNet-depth` to loosely control image generation using depth
images.

[Example folder](./loose_controlnet_example) contains an simple workflow for using LooseControlNet in ComfyUI.

## Contributing

If you like it, you can contribute by:

* Upvote this [issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/6354) in `diffusers` repo or possibly make a PR to
  resolve it.
* Bring consistency mechanisms devised in LooseControl to frameworks like A1111's WebUI or ComfyUI.
* Bring box editors to frameworks like A1111's WebUI or ComfyUI.
* Perhaps train a better LooseControlNet
